General Usage Information:
==========================

WMTimer can be configured either at run time via the command line or by using
the GTK interface by clicking on the main part of the window 
(anywhere except the buttons).

- To switch to the Chrono function simply click on the right arrow button to 
  start the chronograph.

- You can pause the chronogaph by clicking on the center, rectangle button 
  and resume again by clicking the right arrow button.

- You can reset the timer by clicking on the left arrow button.

- Time entered via the command line must be in the form of x:x:x.  You don't 
  need to have 2 digits for each number but you must have at least zero's in 
  as placeholders for hours, minutes and seconds. 


Using WMTimer To Execute A Command:
===================================

Command line:

- If you have multiple words you must put the command in qoutes.
	eg. wmtimer -c -t 0:0:3 -e "rxvt -e telnet home"
- If you only have one word, then no quotes are needed.
	eg. wmtimer -c -t 0:0:3 -e rxvt
- If you have a long, multiword filename as part of the command you must put 
  the whole thing in double quotes and the filename in single quotes.  
	eg. wmtimer -c -t 0:0:3 -e "mpg123 '/mp3/Creed - Higher.mp3'"


GUI Interface:
==============

- The only time you need quotes is when are running a program with an argument 
  that contains spaces. 
	eg. mpg123 "/mp3/Creed - Higher.mp3"
